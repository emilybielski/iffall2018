			<em id="verse">[Verse 1]</em><br/>
			Woke up a little too late this morning	<br/>
			But I think I'll be okay	<br/>
			I'll be okay	<br/>
			Damn, my car still smells like marijuana	<br/>
			My mom is gonna kill me 	<br/>
			Gonna kill me 	<br/>
			Traffic's backed up from corner to corner <br/>
			So I guess I'll hit the highway	<br/>
			The highway	<br/>
			Shake away all the stress off my shoulders	<br/>
			Gonna have a good day	<br/>
			A good day	
		</p>

		<p>
			<em id="verse">[Chorus]</em><br/>
			Because I'm eighteen<br/>
			And I still live with my parents<br/>
			Yeah they're not like yours<br/>
			Well yours are more understanding<br/>
			I've never fell in love<br/>
			I saved those feelings for you<br/>
			So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do<br/>
			It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
		</p>

		<p>
			<em id="verse">[Verse 2]</em><br/>
			No I've never really been the smartest<br/>
			Yeah I've made my mistakes<br/>
			My mistakes<br/>
			You were there when times were at their darkest<br/>
			Always showing me the way<br/>
			Lead the way<br/>
			Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest<br/>
			You'll always have a part of me<br/>
			A part of me<br/>
			Losing you has always been the hardest<br/>
			I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)
		</p>

		<p>
			<em id="verse">[Chorus]</em><br/>
			'Cause I was eighteen<br/>
			And I still lived with my parents<br/>
			Yeah they're not like yours<br/>
			Well yours were more understanding<br/>
			I never fell in love<br/>
			I saved those feelings for you<br/>
			When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do<br/>
			Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
		</p>

			You<br/>
			You, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			Hey. . . hey

			<em id="verse">[Chorus]</em> </br>
			Because I'm eighteen<br/>
			And I still live with my parents<br/>
			Yeah they're not like yours<br/>
			Well yours are more understanding<br/>
			I've never fell in love<br/>
			I saved those feelings for you<br/>
			So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do<br/>
			Itâ€™s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
			Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
