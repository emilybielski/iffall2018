		<h1> Get You </h1>
		<h2> Daniel Caesar feat. Kali Uchis

			</br>
			</br>
			</br>

		<p> <em>[Verse 1]</em></br>
			Through drought and famine, natural disasters </br>
			My baby has been around for me</br>
			Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling</br>
			None of that could ever make me leave
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>[Pre-Chorus]</em></br>
			Every time I look into your eyes I see it</br>
			You're all I need</br>
			Every time I get a bit inside I feel it</br>
		</p>

		<p id="chorus">
			<em id="chorus">[Chorus]</em></br>
			Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you</br>
			Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>[Verse 2]</em></br>
			And when we're making love</br>
			Your cries they can be heard from far and wide</br>
			It's only the two of us</br>
			Everything I need's between those thighs
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>[Pre-Chorus]</em></br>
			Every time I look into your eyes I see it</br>
			You're all I need</br>
			Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
		</p>

		<p id="chorus">
			<em id="chorus">[Chorus]</em></br>
			Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you (oh yeah, oh yeah babe)</br>
			Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>[Verse 3]</em></br>
			And I'll take some time</br>
			Just to be thankful</br>
			That I had days full of you, you</br>
			Before it winds down into</br>
			The memories, it's all just memories</br>
			La-la-la-la-la
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>[Bridge]</em></br>
			If you've got someone you like</br>
			Feel something that's right</br>
			Somebody just tell somebody</br>
			If you've got someone you like</br>
			(Don't you love when I come around)</br>
			Feel something that's right</br>
			Somebody just tell somebody</br>
			(Build you up then I take you down)</br>
			If you've got someone you like</br>
			(Don't you love when I come around)</br>
			Feel something that's right</br>
			Somebody just tell somebody</br>
			(Build you up then I take...)
		</p>

		<p id="chorus">
			<em id="chorus">[Chorus]</em></br>
			Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you</br>
			Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>[Outro]</em></br>
			This feels like summer</br>
			Boy you make me feel so alive</br>
			Just be my lover</br>
			Boy you'll lead me to paradise
		</p>
