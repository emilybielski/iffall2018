	<h1> Emily Bielski - Recipe Page Notes </h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nice color palette, works well with cookies</li>
			<li>Make sure spacing and leading are consistant</li>
			<li>Leading a little tight for numbered list</li>
			<li>Need citation for photo and recipe</li>
			<li>".test" shows up at the end of the lines in the numbered list</li>
			<li>Adding cook time, prep time, and yield could be useful for baking</li>
			<li>Make the color of the bullets and numbers match</li>
			<li>Consider centering title, and making it more expressive</li>
			<li>Consider purpose of the footer--seems like unconsidered space</li>
			<li>Margin around image does not quite seem even, top margin looks different</li>
		</ul>
